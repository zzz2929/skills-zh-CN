# DXF generation and validation

Provenance: maintained in [earthtojake/text-to-cad](https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad).
Use the installed local skill files as the runtime source of truth; the
repository link is only for provenance and release review.

## Purpose

Create or modify 2D DXF drawings from natural-language requirements or from CAD geometry, generate validated drawing artifacts, and return checked outputs. A DXF drawing's source of truth is a dedicated Python generator file named `<name>.dxf.py` defining `gen_dxf()`; the CLI owns output paths.

The default build product is the **drawing package** — a render artifact the CAD Viewer serves and auto-regenerates:

```
<model-folder>/__cadgen__/models/<name>.dxf.py/
  drawing.json    # provenance + freshness descriptor
  drawing.dxf     # the built DXF (the exchange artifact)
  preview.glb     # the baked 3D flat pattern (what the viewer renders)
```

`preview.glb` is baked from `drawing.dxf` by a Node child of the build, inside the same
generation lock, so a build produces both payloads or neither. It needs `node` on PATH (or
`CADGEN_NODE`).

The sibling `<name>.dxf` file is written **on demand only** (`--write`, `-o`, or a `SOURCE=OUTPUT` pair) for deliverables handed to cutting services or other tools. An exported `.dxf` is a point-in-time deliverable, totally detached from its generator: rebuilds never delete, rewrite, or staleness-track it (same as an exported STEP file) — re-export when you want it refreshed. Do not commit generated `.dxf` outputs; the package cache is gitignored and rebuilt on demand.

## The three DXF workflows

Copy the full generator template for the applicable workflow from `references/generator-templates.md` when creating a new drawing.

1. **DXF generated from scratch** (standalone drafting — gaskets, panels, templates, cut layouts with no 3D model behind them): a `<name>.dxf.py` that builds an `ezdxf` document directly.
2. **DXF derived from a generated STEP part** (flat patterns / profiles of a `$cad` model): a `<name>.dxf.py` beside the `<name>.step.py` it projects. Generator entry files use dotted extensions and cannot be imported by module name, so reuse the STEP source's geometry by path-loading it:

   ```python
   from pathlib import Path
   from cadgen.sources import load_source_module

   _step = load_source_module(Path(__file__).with_name("bracket.step.py"))

   def gen_dxf():
       return {"document": _step.build_dxf()}
   ```

   Keep the shared drawing logic (e.g. a `build_dxf()` helper that unfolds the part via `cadgen.flatten`) in the `.step.py` or a plain helper module; the `.dxf.py` is the drawing entry point. The loaded `.step.py` and its imports are recorded in the drawing's source closure, so editing the 3D part automatically invalidates the cached drawing.
3. **DXF derived from an imported STEP** (a `.step`/`.stp` file with no Python source): a `<name>.dxf.py` that reads the STEP (e.g. `build123d.import_step`) and projects it with `cadgen.flatten`. Only Python sources are freshness inputs — like a `gen_step()` that composes imported STEPs, the drawing does not auto-rebuild when the imported file changes; rerun with `--force` after replacing it.

`gen_dxf()` must live in a dedicated `.dxf.py` file: a source defining both `gen_step()` and `gen_dxf()` is rejected. A plain `<name>.py` defining only `gen_dxf()` is still accepted as an explicit CLI target (the CLI is naming-agnostic), but only `.dxf.py` files are catalog entries the CAD Viewer lists and rebuilds.

## Use this skill when

Use this skill when the user asks for DXF files, 2D drawings, profiles, outlines, templates, gaskets, panels, flat patterns, or cut layouts for laser, plasma, waterjet, or CNC routing.

Use `$cad` for the 3D part or assembly a DXF derives from. Use `$sendcutsend` for SendCutSend-specific upload preflight.

## Defaults

Use these defaults unless the user specifies otherwise:

- Units: millimeters; set them explicitly on the document (`doc.units = ezdxf.units.MM`).
- Geometry lives in modelspace at 1:1 scale.
- Cut profiles are closed polylines or closed line/arc loops; open contours only for engraving or reference geometry (generation validation enforces this — see Validation).
- For CAD-backed parts, derive DXF cut contours from the actual STEP/solid topology with `cadgen.flatten`: select the real planar faces (`planar_faces`), project and union them (`union_projected_faces`), and emit clean closed contours (`add_shapely_geometry`). Use hand-drawn parametric outlines only when there is no reliable 3D topology to project.
- Apply kerf / tool-radius compensation with `cadgen.flatten.offset_geometry` / `offset_closed_points` when the cutting process requires it; do not hand-offset coordinates.
- Layers carry intent: keep cut geometry and bend/fold lines on separate layers, and include "bend" in bend-layer names so downstream tools classify them as bends rather than cuts.
- DXF layers are drawing structure, not STEP part/assembly structure.

## Tool

The skill has two launchers, split on who the source is — the same split the CAD
skill uses between `scripts/gen` and `scripts/artifact`:

```bash
python scripts/gen targets... [flags]        # gen_dxf() Python generators
python scripts/artifact target [flags]       # one drawing, INCLUDING an imported .dxf
python scripts/snapshot --input <drawing> --output <file.png>   # render it
```

Use the active project Python interpreter; treat `python` as an interpreter placeholder, and use `--help` for the full interface. Target paths resolve from the command's current working directory; run from the workspace that owns the artifacts with cwd-relative target paths. Keep a drawing generator in the same directory as the geometry it derives from, named `<name>.dxf.py`.

A DXF target is a Python source defining:

```python
def gen_dxf():
    ...
    return {"document": document}  # or a bare ezdxf document
```

Every run builds/refreshes the drawing package. Flags:

- `--write` — also write the sibling `<name>.dxf` export.
- `-o`/`--output PATH` — export to a custom path; only with one plain generated Python target.
- `SOURCE.dxf.py=OUTPUT.dxf` positional pairs — per-target custom export paths.
- `--force` — rebuild even when the cached drawing package is current (an unchanged source closure is otherwise skipped).
- `--validate` — validate existing `.dxf` FILES with the generation-time drawing checks instead of generating.

Do not put output paths in the `gen_dxf()` return value.

`scripts/gen` runs generators only. An imported `.dxf` has no generator to run, so it
goes through `scripts/artifact` instead:

```bash
python scripts/artifact path/to/imported.dxf
python scripts/artifact path/to/source.dxf.py --force
```

That builds the same hidden `__cadgen__` drawing package the CAD Viewer builds on
demand — the drawing DXF plus the 3D `preview.glb` the viewport renders — and accepts
either source kind, so it is also how you debug a generated drawing's package build.
Flags: `--write PATH` (also write the package's drawing DXF there), `--force`,
`--verbose`.

`scripts/snapshot` renders a drawing's 3D flat pattern to a PNG still or an orbit GIF:

```bash
python scripts/snapshot --input path/to/imported.dxf --output review.png
python scripts/snapshot --input path/to/source.dxf.py --output turntable.gif --mode orbit
```

It builds/refreshes the drawing package first, then renders that package's `preview.glb`
through the shared snapshot CLI (`cadgen.snapshot_cli`) and the same headless browser
runtime every rendering skill uses — so geometry and materials render identically to the CAD
Viewer; the default `snapshot` theme differs from the viewport only by dropping the grid,
origin axis and shadows. The
package build is the same locked `artifact_build(DRAWING_PACKAGE)` that `scripts/artifact`
and the viewer run, so a snapshot cannot race one of them.

Flags: `--mode view|orbit|list`, `--camera`, `--theme`, `--size-profile`,
`--width`/`--height`, `--job`, `--force`, `--json`. Theme settings live under one
`--theme`, mirroring the viewer's Theme tab; the default theme is `snapshot`, Workbench
Light without the ground grid, origin axis or shadows. There is no `--display`, and no
selector, parameter, section or exploded options: a drawing carries no CAD topology, and
display settings are CAD topology settings.

No CLI inspects an existing `.dxf`. For entity/layer checks use `ezdxf` directly,
and `--validate` for the drawing checks; review geometry visually with `$cad-viewer`.

## Workflow

1. Convert the request into a short brief: outline dimensions, holes and slots, layers, units, output path, and validation targets.
2. Pick the workflow: standalone drafting, projection of a generated STEP (create and validate the STEP geometry with `$cad` first), or projection of an imported STEP (declare it in `sources`).
3. Write or edit the `<name>.dxf.py` source with meaningful dimensions as named parameters, reusing the STEP source's geometry helpers instead of duplicating formulas.
4. Run `scripts/gen` on explicit Python source targets only; do not run directory-wide generation.

```bash
python scripts/gen path/to/source.dxf.py
python scripts/gen path/to/source.dxf.py --write
python scripts/gen path/to/source.dxf.py -o path/to/output.dxf
python scripts/gen path/to/a.dxf.py=out/a.dxf path/to/b.dxf.py=out/b.dxf
```

5. Validate the generated DXF deterministically, then hand off and report.

## Viewer integration

`<name>.dxf.py` files are CAD Viewer catalog entries, listed whether or not their drawing package has been built. Opening one triggers the unified render-artifact flow: a missing or stale package (any source-closure file — the generator, its path-loaded `.step.py` sources, and helper modules — newer than the descriptor) rebuilds automatically. The viewer's export dropdown offers "Download DXF" on generated drawings (it refreshes the package first, so the export is never stale). An imported `.dxf` is artifact-managed too — the viewer builds its drawing package on demand, exactly as it does for an imported `.step` — but it is never a `dxf` CLI target: the CLI builds `.dxf.py` generators only.

## Validation

Validation happens IN generation, not after: every `gen_dxf()` build runs the drawing checks on the in-memory document before the package or any export is written, and a build with error findings fails. The checks: cut-layer profiles must close (polylines, circles, or chained line/arc loops), zero-length/degenerate entities are rejected, exact duplicate geometry (double-cut risk) is rejected, explicitly unitless documents are rejected, and an empty modelspace is rejected. Open geometry is allowed only on bend/engrave/reference-intent layers (matched by name).

The same checks run post-hoc on any existing `.dxf` file:

```bash
python scripts/gen --validate path/to/file.dxf
```

Beyond the built-in checks, verify requested dimensions with targeted `ezdxf` reads (entity counts by layer, drawing extents, every dimension the user specified) against the built DXF in the drawing package (or the exported path when one was requested), and review geometry visually in the CAD Viewer:

```python
import ezdxf

doc = ezdxf.readfile("path/to/__cadgen__/models/source.dxf.py/drawing.dxf")
msp = doc.modelspace()
profiles = [e for e in msp.query("LWPOLYLINE") if e.closed]
holes = msp.query('CIRCLE[layer=="0"]')
```

Report only checks that actually ran.

## Handoff

After creating or modifying DXF drawings, you must ALWAYS hand the explicit `.dxf.py` file path(s) to `$cad-viewer` when that skill is installed and include its live viewer link(s) in the final response. If `$cad-viewer` is unavailable or startup fails, report that and rely on `ezdxf` checks instead of silently omitting the handoff.

Final responses should include generated files, returned viewer links, validation actually run, and assumptions.

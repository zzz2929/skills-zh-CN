# build123d modeling patterns

Read this file when writing or repairing build123d Python source.

## Modeling objective

Create a valid STEP-ready BREP model, not a visual mesh. Prefer closed solids, explicit labels, and stable parametric dimensions. Define `gen_step()` returning the STEP-ready shape or labeled compound; the CLI owns output paths (see `step-generation.md`). Name a buildable entry generator `<name>.step.py` (the marker the viewer and build tools scan for); keep `<name>.py` for helper/library modules that are only imported, not built on their own (see "Entry generators are named `<name>.step.py`" in `step-generation.md`).

## Design strategy

Decide how the part is constructed before writing geometry code:

- **Choose the construction that makes the spec's dimensions direct parameters.** Profile-driven shapes get one closed sketch plus `extrude`/`revolve`/`sweep`/`loft`; block-and-feature parts get a base solid plus subtractive features. Prefer whichever construction lets the user's controlling dimensions appear as named parameters instead of derived values.
- **Decide part vs assembly before modeling.** Bodies that are separately manufactured, purchased, or movable belong in a labeled assembly (see `positioning.md`); monolithic manufacturing intent gets a single fused solid. Avoid unlabeled compounds of solids — multi-body output without occurrence labels loses traceability in inspection and viewer review.
- **Pick the origin and orientation from the functional datum before sculpting.** Model on the mating interface, mounting plane, or symmetry axis; see `positioning.md` for part-type origin defaults.
- **Order operations so fragile steps come last and failures localize.** Base solid → major additions → subtractive features → shell → through-wall holes → fillets and chamfers last. Fillets are the most failure-prone operation and every boolean invalidates selectors, so postpone them. Structure the source so each feature is a named step — a per-feature function or a distinct intermediate variable — so a failed operation points at exactly one feature and a parameter change touches one obvious place.
- **Overshoot boolean tools.** Extend cutting tools past the faces they enter and exit; for through-cuts, go roughly 1 mm beyond both faces. Coincident or coplanar tool/target faces are a classic kernel failure. Cut repeated or patterned features in one combined operation.
- **Sanity-check proportions before generating.** Compare the expected bounding box against the real-world object, wall thickness against overall size, and feature positions against edges and neighboring features. Order-of-magnitude and collision errors pass geometric validation but fail visual review.

## Topology stack

Think in this order:

```text
Vertex → Edge → Wire → Face → Shell → Solid → Compound
```

For assemblies, use these repo topology terms consistently:

- **Occurrence**: a placed node in the assembly tree. An occurrence has a parent, transform, path, and user-facing role such as `lid` or `m3_screw:front_left`.
- **Shape**: an exported geometry/body inside an occurrence. Shape rows own topology; faces and edges belong to a shape, and the shape belongs to an occurrence.
- **Face/edge**: selectable topology owned by a shape. Do not assume arbitrary faces or edges have persistent intent labels; inspect them by occurrence, shape, ordinal, surface/curve type, and measured geometry.

When inspecting topology, follow `assembly occurrence -> shape/body -> faces -> edges`. Every face/edge row should be traceable through both `occurrenceId` and `shapeId`.

For normal STEP output, return one of:

- a valid `Solid`
- a compound of valid solids
- a labeled assembly compound

Avoid returning loose wires, open faces, or construction surfaces unless the user explicitly requested them.

## Parameters first

Put meaningful dimensions in named variables:

```python
width = 80.0
depth = 50.0
thickness = 6.0
hole_diameter = 4.5
hole_offset_x = 30.0
hole_offset_y = 17.5
```

Avoid burying important numbers inside geometry calls.

## Coordinate system

Declare or comment the convention:

```text
Origin: center of primary part or chosen mating datum
XY: main base/sketch plane
+Z: up/extrusion direction
```

Use `Location`, `Plane`, and `Axis` intentionally. For positioning-sensitive tasks and source-level assembly relationships, read `positioning.md`.

## Builder contexts

Use the context that matches the geometry:

```python
with BuildLine() as path:
    ...

with BuildSketch() as profile:
    ...

with BuildPart() as part:
    ...
```

Typical flow:

```text
curves/paths → sketches/profiles → solids/features → labels → STEP
```

## Selection practices

Avoid fragile topology order when possible. Select by:

- axis or normal
- location or bounding position
- plane grouping
- feature intent
- stable construction plane
- inspected local selector ref for downstream validation

For source operations, prefer robust selectors such as top/bottom by axis or position rather than arbitrary list indexes.


## Assemblies and positioning

For assemblies, keep this file focused on BREP modeling patterns and labels. Use `positioning.md` as the single source of truth for:

- part-local coordinate conventions
- when to use `cadgen.assembly.AssemblyHelper`, build123d joints, or explicit `Location` transforms
- `connect_to()` behavior
- CLI `inspect align` as read-only selector-pair alignment validation
- frame, measure, and positioning report expectations

## Labels and assemblies

Label every exported part and assembly child with native build123d labels. Prefer concise intent labels through `cadgen.assembly` helpers:

```python
from cadgen.assembly import AssemblyHelper, label_shape

asm = AssemblyHelper("electronics_enclosure")
base = asm.add(make_base(), "base")
lid = asm.add(make_lid(), "lid")

boss = label_shape(Cylinder(radius=3.0, height=12.0), "m3_boss", "front_left")
```

Do not prefix labels with topology categories like assembly, component, feature, datum, mate, or hardware. The assembly tree and topology inspection already expose those structural categories. Use labels for the intent topology cannot reliably infer: role, placement, interface, repetition, or mating purpose. Feature labels survive STEP export best when the feature remains a labeled child shape in a `Compound`; boolean-subtracted or fused feature history should be represented by source parameters, named datums, and validation refs instead of assumed persistent feature labels.

Label for inspection:

- Label the root assembly.
- Label every exported part, subassembly/module, and repeated component occurrence.
- Use occurrence labels for assembly role and placement, especially repeated parts: `m3_screw:front_left`, `m3_screw:rear_right`.
- Use shape labels for retained exported geometry/body roles where useful.
- Use feature/datum labels only when that geometry remains exported as a child shape.
- Use named mate datums for source-level positioning intent, then validate the exported STEP topology and occurrence frames.

Occurrence and shape labels are exported through STEP names and surfaced in `STEP_topology` when available. The viewer uses occurrence labels for assembly/tree references and shape labels for shape references. Faces and edges inherit their context from `occurrenceId` and `shapeId`; do not promise persistent face/edge intent labels unless explicit tested support exists.

For repeated parts, keep occurrence labels, transforms, or joint connections explicit and inspect frames/positioning after generation.

## Colour

Two rules, both of which fail silently — no error, just a model that looks wrong.

**Channels are LINEAR RGB, not sRGB.** The renderer converts them to sRGB on the
way to the screen, so `Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)` displays as roughly `#BCBCBC`, not
`#808080`. Picking channel values off a hex palette by eye gives a washed-out,
desaturated model. Author with `cadgen.srgb()`, which takes the hex you want to
see:

```python
from cadgen import srgb

body.color = srgb("#2E3742")
glass.color = srgb("#38414D", 0.42)   # with alpha
```

**Colour on a group compound is ignored.** Only *leaf* occurrences carry colour
into the render package, so a colour set on a `Compound` that has children never
reaches the screen. It does reach the STEP file's XCAF label, which is why this
looks like it worked if you only check the STEP. Colour every leaf.

## Rotating a plane

`Plane.rotated()` composes its matrix in **WORLD axes, not the plane's own**.
On a plane whose axes are not the global ones this is the single most expensive
trap in the library, because the result is a valid solid of the wrong shape.

For a spanwise aerofoil section — `x_dir=(-1,0,0)`, `z_dir=(0,1,0)`, i.e. local
+x rearward and the normal along +Y — `plane.rotated((0, 0, twist))` reads like
a pitch and is actually a **yaw about world Z**. Measured on a 200 mm chord: a
20 deg "twist" put the trailing edge at `(812.0, -68.4, 99.4)` when it should
be at `(812.1, 0.0, 168.4)`. The section slid 68 mm sideways out of its own
spanwise station and rose nothing.

Nothing downstream catches it. The loft succeeds, the solid is closed,
watertight and free of self-intersections, and `scripts/inspect refs --facts`
passes it. Only looking at a render finds it.

Build the frame from explicit direction vectors instead:

```python
# incidence about the span axis, then yaw the whole frame
t, s = math.radians(twist_deg), math.radians(sweep_deg)
x_dir  = Vector(-math.cos(t) * math.cos(s), -math.cos(t) * math.sin(s), math.sin(t))
normal = Vector(-math.sin(s), math.cos(s), 0.0)
plane = Plane(origin=Vector(*origin), x_dir=x_dir, z_dir=normal)
```

The same applies to rolling a section about a swept member's own axis: use a
Rodrigues rotation about that axis rather than `Plane.rotated()`.

## Multi-section lofts match sections BY INDEX

A loft interpolates its sections point index by point index. If you sample each
station at fractions of THAT station's own width, a feature — a crest, a
silhouette edge — sits at a different index at every station, and the surface
twists between them to reconcile them. The result is valid, watertight,
bilaterally symmetric, passes `inspect validate`, and renders as **crumpled
foil** over every square metre. Nothing reports it; only a render finds it.

Sample on **rails**: compute the lateral position of each feature line per
station and allocate a fixed number of points to each rail-to-rail band, so
index *i* means the same feature everywhere. Cluster samples toward the rails —
that is where curvature is worst, so even spacing inside a band leaves the
sharpest part of the curve least resolved.

Two more ways a control curve silently ruins a lofted surface:

- **`smoothstep` between control points makes a staircase.**
  `lerp(v0, v1, smoothstep(x0, x1, x))` has zero derivative at BOTH ends of every
  interval, so the curve is flat at each control point and steep between them.
  Lofting through such curves puts a crease at every knot. Use a monotone cubic
  (PCHIP) instead.
- **Measurement noise becomes surface ripple.** Station data traced off a scan
  carries ~a pixel of noise; a monotone interpolant reproduces it exactly and the
  loft turns it into visible waves. Smooth the control curve before lofting.

## Blending volumes: a closed lobe that ends inside the body is a cliff

When sections are built by smooth-max/min over component volumes, any closed
convex profile meets its own silhouette on a **vertical tangent**. Where such a
lobe closes *inside* the body — against a neighbouring shelf or lobe — you get a
near-vertical wall no blend width and no sample density can round off. Extra
sampling does not help: the corner is in the function, not the sampling.

- Widen the lobe until it OVERLAPS its neighbour and cut the real feature back in
  afterwards, rather than letting it close between them.
- Give a feature that needs its own width its own lobe. One half-width cannot
  serve both a wide fuselage and a narrow canopy.
- Prefer a **compact-support polynomial** smooth-max to the softplus/log-sum-exp
  form: softplus perturbs the surface everywhere and its curvature is unbounded
  as the blend narrows. Use the **cubic** (`h**3`) form, not the quadratic
  (`h*(1-h)`) one — the quadratic is only C1, so curvature JUMPS at the edge of
  the blend band, and a curvature jump on a specular surface draws a visible
  line.

## Validity is not positive volume

`Shape.is_valid` (and `BRepCheck_Analyzer`) can return **True for a shell with a
large negative volume** — an inverted orientation. Such a body exports and
renders as a hole in the world. Check both:

```python
def is_valid_shape(shape):
    return (shape is not None
            and BRepCheck_Analyzer(shape.wrapped).IsValid()
            and shape.volume > 0.0)
```

Related: a boolean can leave a body that is geometrically right but
topologically invalid — correct bounds and volume, one bad face. It survives
until the next boolean, which then fails with `Null TopoDS_Shape object` from a
call nowhere near the cause. `ShapeFix_Shape` repairs many of these; gate every
boolean result rather than trusting the last operation.

`scripts/inspect validate` runs both of these gates plus closure and
self-intersection over every occurrence, so this does not have to be hand-rolled
per model. Note it measures volume **per solid**: an inverted member inside a
compound cancels against a sound one, so anything reading a compound's aggregate
volume sees nothing wrong.

## A revolve puts its seam at +X

A 360-degree `revolve` leaves a seam edge where its profile started, and
sketching on `Plane.XZ` places that seam at **+X**. If the presentation camera
looks down +X, every revolved casting renders with a thin panel line down its
visible face — on parts whose whole point is a smooth, sealed surface.

This is not limited to `revolve`: a plain `Cylinder` primitive seams at +X too,
verified with a marker probe. Any large smooth camera-facing cylinder is
affected.

Rotate the finished body about Z so the seam lands away from the camera. Two
cautions:

- A body carrying discrete features (a bolt ring, a stud circle) must be rotated
  by a whole number of feature pitches, or left alone and its *prototype*
  rotated instead — `bolt_ring`-style helpers only translate their prototype, so
  seam-hiding the prototype does not move the ring.
- A body offset from the origin must be rotated about **its own** axis: build it
  at the origin, rotate, then translate. Rotating in place about global Z flies
  it across the model.

Prove the fix with two renders — the seam absent from the camera face **and**
present on the far side. Without the second render you cannot tell a hidden seam
from one that was never visible at that angle.

## Fillet retry ladders degrade silently

The `pipe()`-style retry ladder (`[bend, .7, .5, .3, 20]` around
`FilletPolyline`) exists for a good reason: one oversized corner otherwise kills
an entire build with `BRep_API: command not done`. But it converts a hard
failure into an invisible cosmetic regression.

Where a profile cannot accept the nominal radius, the ladder silently falls back
— a 6 mm rim fillet became ~2 mm on a 660 mm-diameter flange, which tessellates
as a visible sawtooth. The build reports success; only a render cropped to ~5x
shows it.

Do not rely on the ladder for cosmetic radii. Reshape the profile so the
intended radius genuinely fits (a knife-edged wafer cannot take any fillet;
merge it into its neighbour), then verify by cropping the render.

## Multi-tool booleans: one list operation, internally disjoint batches

Never accumulate boolean tools pairwise — `body - a - b - c` re-runs the whole
intersection network per step and decays O(n²). Pass every tool in one list
operand: `body - [a, b, c, ...]`.

Two caveats, both measured:

- **Tools that overlap each other deep below the surface are pathological.**
  ~200 shallow spherical dimples cut with full spheres (radii ~15 mm for
  0.02 mm-deep stamps) ran >40 CPU-minutes with zero output; pre-clipping each
  stamp to a small disjoint "lens cap" (`Sphere & Cylinder` prototype,
  translated copies) cut the same field in 0.69 s. Keep tools small and
  mutually disjoint.
- **A single multi-tool cut whose tools overlap each other can emit wrong
  results.** A bore cylinder crossing a stack of thin ring cutters returned
  5 solids: the body, the bore's uncut PLUG kept as a detached solid, and
  knife-edge slivers. Every tool was individually valid; splitting the same
  tools into two staged subtracts (functional cuts, then finishing cuts)
  yielded one clean solid. Batch tool FAMILIES so each batch is
  internally disjoint-ish — still list-based, never pairwise.

## Near-tangent booleans silently drop material

Intersecting or subtracting nearly tangent surfaces (a huge shallow sphere
kissing a small revolve, a flat dome tool grazing a face) can succeed with
exit 0 and a validate-clean result while half a tool's material was simply not
removed — or a stray disjoint sliver is left floating inside the part. Only
visual review catches it. Build shallow domes as a single revolved profile
(`RadiusArc` in the section) instead of near-tangent boolean stacks; it is
also crisper.

## Do not 3D-chamfer tangent chains or multi-arc outlines

OCC `chamfer`/`fillet` on edges that belong to a tangent chain (a domed face
meeting cap cylinders) or to a multi-arc "blob" outline behaves three ways
depending only on exact dimensions: silent failure, minutes of CPU churn per
attempt, or an **uncatchable SIGSEGV** that kills the whole build. Chamfering
edges NEXT TO already-beveled arcs can also hard-crash. Retry ladders multiply
the churn and hide the degradation.

Bake the bevel into construction instead: put it in the extruded/lofted
SECTION profile, or build the body straight-walled to `z_top - w` and cap it
with `extrude(..., taper=45)` (or per-arc `Cone` caps when the draft prism
itself fails). Constructive bevels also survive later booleans, which
chamfered edges often do not.

## 2D sketch algebra decays; winding decides extrude direction

Chained 2D unions are fragile in three stacked ways, all silent:

- `Circle + Circle` returns a fused `Face`, and the next `Face + Polygon`
  falls into raw shape fuse returning an unregularized face pile; once any
  step yields a `ShapeList`, later `+` is Python list concatenation, not
  geometry. Build each profile as ONE multi-operand fuse:
  `first + [rest...]`.
- A CLOCKWISE-wound `Polygon` fuses as a reversed face: the union "succeeds"
  but shatters into mixed-normal fragments and `extrude()` runs along the
  reversed normals — solids appear mirrored below the plane. Wind every
  polygon CCW. **Mirroring a point list reverses its winding**: mirror with
  `[(-y, z) for y, z in reversed(pts)]`, or the extrude silently runs the
  other way and the cutter lands off the part.
- `ShapeList & Sketch` used as a regularizing clip returns an EMPTY list with
  no error, and the following extrude quietly produces a zero-volume part.
  Apply the `& clip` intersection exactly once, LAST, on the single fused
  profile.

## `align=(None, None, None)` is the raw OCC datum, not "centered"

`Cylinder`/`Cone` with `align=(None, None, None)` sit base-at-z=0 (XY
centered); `Box` sits with its CORNER at the origin. Code written assuming
"None means centered" produces silently wrong geometry — off-center slots,
inverted countersinks, cutters that remove nothing because they sit entirely
above the surface. Two independent modules shipped defects from this exact
assumption. Default alignment IS centered; reserve `align=None` for when the
raw datum is genuinely wanted.

## `.located()` SETS the placement; `.moved()` composes with it

`Shape.rotate()` returns a rotated copy. Placing that copy with
`.located(Location(pos))` throws the rotation away: `located` assigns an
ABSOLUTE location, so what lands at `pos` is the ORIGINAL orientation.
`.moved()` is the one that composes.

```python
box = Solid.make_box(1, 1, 1)          # x[0,1]
r   = box.rotate(Axis.Z, 90)           # x[-1,0]   rotation applied

r.located(Location((5, 0, 0)))         # x[5,6]    rotation DISCARDED
r.moved(Location((5, 0, 0)))           # x[4,5]    rotation kept
box.located(Location((5, 0, 0), (0, 0, 90)))   # x[4,5]  one Location carrying both
```

Nothing raises, and the bounding box moves the distance you asked for, so the
result looks placed. Verified on build123d 0.11.1.

The failure mode is a sweep that reads as physics. Placing a part with
`.rotate(...).located(...)` inside a loop over angles feeds `intersect()` the
same unrotated shape every iteration, so a gear-mesh collision check returns an
identical volume to 15 significant digits at every phase — a flat, plausible
curve rather than an error. Reach for `.moved()` when a shape already carries a
transform, or build one `Location(position, rotation)` and `.located()` that.

## Dense periodic spline profiles: kernel ops to avoid

On faces bounded by one periodic `Spline` fit through hundreds of samples,
several kernel operations fail or corrupt (verified on build123d 0.10 /
OCP 7.9): `extrude(face, taper=...)` throws `BRepFill_TrimSurfaceTool:
incoherent intersection`; kernel wire `offset` returns Null for some inward
deltas; fusing two valid solids that share a coincident spline-bounded planar
face can return an EMPTY result; and a ruled loft to an inward offset is
analyzer-invalid where the outer wire's corner radius is smaller than the
offset. Compute offsets NUMERICALLY on the sample loop (normal offset, prune
points closer than |delta| to the source polyline, resample, smooth) and build
beveled bodies as one multi-section ruled loft so no coincident-face fuse
exists.

## Gate boolean results with the BOP check, not volume

`result.volume > 0` and even `BRepCheck_Analyzer.IsValid()` both accept
chamfer and V-groove-cut results whose skinny faces are BOP-faulty
(`BOPAlgo_SelfIntersect`, `BOPAlgo_TooSmallEdge`). The failure then surfaces
only in `scripts/inspect validate` (`selfIntersecting`), with no pointer to
the causing operation. After tangency-prone cuts and chamfers on wavy
outlines, gate with the same check validation uses — `BRepAlgoAPI_Check` —
and step the operation down or skip it when the check fails.

Related wrap trap: re-wrapping a bare `Solid` as `Part(solid.wrapped)` yields
a shape whose `.volume` is 0 (build123d 0.10), so volume-based guards silently
discard real geometry. Use the `Solid` directly as a compound child (Shape
carries `label`/`color`), or fuse before measuring.

## Common failure modes

- Fillet radius larger than local edge geometry.
- Open sketch profile produces invalid or missing face.
- A loft whose SECTION WIRE self-intersects. `make_face` accepts a
  self-intersecting periodic spline and reports a valid, positive-area face, so
  each station looks fine in isolation; the loft then fails on whichever
  adjacent pair is worst. Bisect by lofting adjacent pairs to find the station.
  Common cause: two points straddling a crease offset along the corner's
  TANGENT lines rather than placed on the curve, so the outline doubles back.
- Smooth `loft()` failing with `BRep_API: command not done` even though every
  section is individually valid and they all share one edge count. Try
  `loft(..., ruled=True)`; with densely spaced sections the result is visually
  equivalent.
- `solid += helper()` where the helper returns a *list*: the accumulator becomes
  a `ShapeList`, and the failure surfaces much later as an anytree
  `Cannot add non-node object` from inside `Compound(children=...)`.
- Face selector changes after a boolean or fillet.
- Part origin is arbitrary and later alignment checks become ambiguous.
- Source-level joints are treated as if they were persistent STEP constraints rather than one-time source placement operations.
- Joint labels are missing, duplicated, or attached to the wrong local datum.
- `.connect_to()` fixes the wrong side of the relationship, moving the part intended to remain fixed.

Use `repair-loop.md` when generation or validation fails.

"""Name the font file that made ``import build123d`` fail.

build123d parses EVERY font in the system font folders at import time:
``build123d/text.py`` ends with ``available_fonts = FontManager().available_fonts``,
whose ``__init__`` calls ``register_system_fonts() -> register_folder() ->
register_font()``, and ``register_font`` hands each file straight to
``fontTools.ttLib.TTFont`` with no per-file guard. One malformed file therefore takes
down ``import build123d`` itself, and with it every cadgen command -- on Windows,
where that scan is the one platform build123d runs it on (OCCT does not pick up user
fonts there).

The failure a user sees is ``TTLibError: Not a TrueType or OpenType font (bad
sfntVersion)``, which names no file. There is nothing to fix here: the guard belongs
in build123d's ``register_folder`` loop, and until it lands the only recovery is to
move the offending file out of the font folder. So this module does the one useful
thing available downstream -- it finds the file and says so.

Deliberately NOT a workaround. Patching around it downstream needs
``fontTools.ttLib.TTFont`` replaced before build123d binds it, and a stand-in that
survives ``_get_font_faces`` would register an empty-named ``Font_SystemFont`` into
OCCT's global font manager. A clear error beats a silently poisoned font table.

Reading four bytes per file, this never parses a font, so it cannot fail the way the
thing it is diagnosing does.

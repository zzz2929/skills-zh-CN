"""Kernel-owned file locking for artifact coordination (POSIX ``flock``, Windows ``msvcrt``).

The KERNEL owns the lock state: it is released when the holding file descriptor closes,
including when the process crashes or is killed. That is the whole reason this is a
``flock`` and not a status file -- it replaced a ``{pid, status, startedAt, updatedAt}``
JSON file refreshed by a 1s heartbeat thread, which had three defects a real lock does not:

* It was never acquired, only written. Two concurrent builds of the same model both
  proceeded, and whichever finished first unlinked the shared file while the other was
  still writing -- so a reader saw "no build in flight" over a half-written package.
* Liveness was inferred from ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` plus a 30s heartbeat window. OCP meshing
  holds the GIL inside C for long stretches, so the heartbeat thread could starve and a
  healthy build would read as dead.
* Producers never waited for each other; only the viewer waited.

**No liveness inference lives here, and none may be added.** No pid checks, no heartbeats,
no age windows. The kernel is the sole authority on "a run is in flight"; the run id in the
sentinel is for ATTRIBUTING a status record to a run, never for deciding one is alive.

Sentinels are never unlinked, and neither is the Windows mutex below. Unlinking races: a
waiter that already opened the file would hold a descriptor to an unlinked inode and
"acquire" a lock nobody else can see. They are zero-to-32-byte files under gitignored
``__cadgen__``.

Readers probe with ``LOCK_SH``, writers take ``LOCK_EX``. That asymmetry matters: ``flock``
conflicts per open file description, not per process, so two concurrent ``LOCK_EX`` probes
of an UNHELD sentinel conflict with each other and one of them wrongly reports a build in
flight. Measured at ~6% false positives with four threads before this was fixed.

On Windows there is no ``fcntl``; :mod:`msvcrt` provides byte-range locks (``locking``)
instead. Kernel-ownership on close behaves the same, but the model differs in three ways
that matter, and the third is why the Windows lock is not taken on the sentinel at all:

* ``msvcrt.locking`` locks a byte region at the CURRENT file position rather than the whole
  descriptor, and locking past EOF is an error, so the file must hold a byte to be lockable.
* It has no shared mode -- every operation, probes included, takes an exclusive region lock,
  so two concurrent Windows probes of one file can false-positive "held" (the very race the
  POSIX shared-probe asymmetry above exists to avoid).
* The lock is MANDATORY, not advisory. Holding byte 0 makes the file unreadable to every
  other process, which broke every Windows DXF build (issue #269): the sentinel is the file
  the Node builders must read to prove they were started by the lock holder.

So on Windows the lock lives on a sibling ``.mutex`` that holds no data and that nothing
reads, while the run id still goes to the unlocked sentinel -- see :func:`mutex_path`.
POSIX locks the sentinel itself, because advisory locking has no such problem.

That split also simplifies the empty-file rule. An empty MUTEX reads as IDLE: it is padded
before the lock is taken, so 0 bytes means no run ever held it. The old rule had to report
UNKNOWN for an empty sentinel instead, because a crash between ``open()`` and stamping left
one legitimately empty, and a lock-past-EOF error must not wedge every later build forever.
